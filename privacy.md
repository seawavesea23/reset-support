# RE:SET App Privacy Policy

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The RE:SET app works entirely on your device. We do not track users, analyze behavior, or connect to external servers.

If you contact us via email, your message may be stored for support purposes. But we don't do anything creepy.

This policy may change if we ever add features that require data. But for now, enjoy your private fast.
